# Suricata-C2
The Suricata rules presented here are based on the blog post [Detection of Command and Control Traffic Using Suricata | cyber.wtf](https://cyber.wtf/2024/12/06/detection-of-c2-using-suricata/), where we detected C2 traffic using Suricata.

Note:
- Not all rules necessarily relate to C2 traffic.
- Rules may need to be adjusted to fit your own infrastructure.
- Tested with Suricata 7.

Feel free to contribute to help detect known malicious parameters with Suricata.
